<div id="section3">
  I am a molecular biologist with a firm interest in plant biotechnology. In the past 5 years, I have worked with 4 entirely different areas in plant science along with 3 different species as a model organism. My interest in plants as a model system arouse from two phenomenas: cellular reprogramming and plasticity. I am interested in studying the molecular mechanisms which give a plant the ability to de-differentiate and re-differentiate in a controlled manner, the ability to survive in extreme conditions , and well-coordinated communication with other species. I have an ambition of studying the cross-talks underlying these metabolic pathways and drawing important patterns from them. Other than my academic interests, I have represented my institution in various speech and sports competitions multiple times.
