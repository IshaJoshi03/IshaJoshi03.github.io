    <ul><li> I have worked towards optimizing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing in Arabidopsis. I was involved in characterization of a suitable promoter for expression of the cas9 gene in Arabidopsis. I have worked on 6 different promoters out of which 4 were pre-designed when I joined the lab and 2 were included after my literature survey.  Other than my project, I have also assisted PhDs of the lab with a small part in their individual projects.
