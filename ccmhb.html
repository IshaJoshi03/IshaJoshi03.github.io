    <ul><li> NPR1 is a very important gene which plays a crucial role in the defence response and establishment of SAR in the plants. NPR1 has been under a very extensive study for past few years and has been characterised in various plant species. There are no transgenic lines available overexpressing the same in any potato variety. My dissertation project involved Identification of NPR1 in Solanum tuberosum, bioinformatic analysis along with its 
        Amplification and Cloning of StNPR1 in sub cloning vector(pGEMT-Easy) and binary vector(pBI121).
