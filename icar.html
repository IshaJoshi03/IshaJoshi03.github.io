    <ul><li> The basic procedure of wheat breeding at ICAR-IARI, Indore included phenotyping and selection of plant based on specific trait followed by screening for homozygous plants by genotyping. The flowers of genotyped female plants were emasculated and bagged and then cross-pollinated with the anthers of selected male parents by dusting the anthers on emasculated female flowers. The hybrids obtained were screened for desired agronomic traits and the one having those were self-pollinated further for some generation. After the evaluation in the research fields, the testing of the hybrids was done in the farmer’s fields, for at least three growing seasons at different locations in the country, representing all the agro-climatic zones followed by releasing of the variety with desired characteristics. In the above I was involved in selection of parent on the basis of phenotyping and genotyping followed by tagging, emasculation, bagging, and cross-pollination by dusting the desired anthers on emasculated female flowers. I have also done the selection of hybrids of the previously cross-pollinated plants on the basic of various agronomic traits like yield, no. of tillers, length of spike, resistance towards pest, no. of spikelet, length of plant, level of growth in limited resources [water and selected nutrients].
